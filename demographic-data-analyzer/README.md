# Demographic Data Analyzer

This is my solution for the Demographic Data Analyzer challenge project of FreeCodeCamp's Data Analysis with Python course. More details can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/demographic-data-analyzer.<br> The course offers a starter code with a test module, so I can focus at the data analysis and verify my solution. To check it, just run main.py.
