# Medical Data Visualizer

This is my solution for the Medical Data Visualizer project of FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python course. The goal was to plot charts to analyze medical examination data using seaborn, matplolib and pandas. The result can be seen in the files <b>catplot.png</b> and <b>heatmap.png</b>. To check if my solution is correct based on the project, just run <b>main.py</b>.
